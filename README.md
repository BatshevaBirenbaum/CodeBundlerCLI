# CodeBundlerCLI

## File Bundler CLI Tool

A simple yet powerful C# command-line tool that bundles multiple source files from subdirectories into a single output file, with support for sorting, filtering, annotation, and customization options.

## 🧰 Key Features

- 🔁 Recursively scans subdirectories (excluding `bin` folders)  
- 🗂 Filters by file extension (e.g., `txt`, `css`, `html`, `json`, `java`, `js`)  
- 📝 Adds file path notes before each file (`--note`)  
- 🧹 Removes empty lines from files (`--remove`)  
- 🔠 Sorts files by name or by extension (`--sort`)  
- ✍️ Inserts author name at the top of the output file (`--author`)  
- ⚙️ Supports `.rsp` file generation for command reuse

📝 Creating an .rsp File (Shortcut Script)
You can run the interactive command to generate a reusable .rsp file:

Copy
Edit
fib create-rsp
The app will prompt you for input and generate a file called RspFile.rsp.
